# Forecasting adaptive thermal comfort exceedance via supervised learning models

This repository provides several different supervised learning approaches to predicting daily thermal comfort exceedances in a naturally-ventilated office building using hourly weather data. Four different approaches are provides, three are methods of Gradient Boosting on Decision Trees (GBDTs), as well as Bayesian Logistic Regression. The Python packages Catboost, LightGBM, NGBoost, and PyMC3 are used.

An explanation of the models, the method, and the case study problem is found in Rysanek et al. (2021).
